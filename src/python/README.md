# Python implementation

BrainF*** Interpreter written in Python

By Preston Corless

## Usage

`uv run main.py [FILE.bf]`

## Performance

Pretty bad compared to the other implementations.

- Completes `hanoi.bf` in 2:02.
- Didn't bother timing it with `mandelbrot.bf` yet, it would probably take several minutes
