# BrainFetch

This is a collection of BrainF*** interpreters I wrote in various languages, both as a test of my abilities and as a test of the general performance of the languages in everyday computation tasks.

The implementations can be found in the `src/` directory.

Current implementations include:

- C (most features)
- Python (slowest)
- Rust (fastest, safest)

## Performance of the interpreters

`mandelbrot.bf`:

| Language | Time |
| - | -:|
| C | 41.7 |
| Python | 32:58.558 |
| Rust | 6.0 |
